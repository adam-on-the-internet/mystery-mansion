# TODO

- Add Logging
  - add log of actions in a particular game
  - add log of actions overall
- Allow the app to "play" a previously created mansion (by code)
- Upload Mansions
  - upload Mansion (.md or otherwise)
  - have a separate app that reads the Mansions to display or even to play the game
- Browser Player
  - find a way to play the game via browser, app, or otherwise
- Physical Companion Guide
  - produce a guide to how to play the game with some home-made pieces
- Twitter Bot
  - develop a twitter bot that tweets about Mansions
- Alternate Furniture, etc
  - create alternate Mansion setup (rooms, furniture, etc)
- Allow selecting a game by the code

## Concepts

- Variations
  - First make a "mansion 2" that works the same but has different rooms, furniture, codes, etc
  - Then make an alternate mansion with a different theme & furniture/clue/etc numbers
  - Then make a different game with a similar system
