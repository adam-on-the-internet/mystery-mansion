# TODO

## Current

- test "small", regress "classic" and "sequel"
- way to "test" that mansions are valid automatically? no duplicates, etc?

- Work on "Sequel", "Small", "Big"
- Add GUI https://realpython.com/pysimplegui-python/
- Humble Assets: House

## Future

- Add Logging
  - add log of actions in a particular game
  - add log of actions overall
- Allow the app to "play" a previously created mansion (by code)
- Upload Mansions
  - upload Mansion (.md or otherwise)
  - have a separate app that reads the Mansions to display or even to play the game
- Browser Player
  - find a way to play the game via browser, app, or otherwise
    - version one: virtual board & virtual pawns (to play with command-line app, it will likely need to be able to play existing games)
    - version two: fully playable in browser
    - version three: fully playable in browser in multiple devices at once
- Physical Companion Guide
  - produce a guide to how to play the game with some home-made pieces
- Twitter Bot
  - develop a twitter bot that tweets about Mansions
- Alternate Furniture, etc
  - create alternate Mansion setup (rooms, furniture, etc)
- Allow selecting a game by the code

## Concepts

- Variations
  - First make a "mansion 2" that works the same but has different rooms, furniture, codes, etc
  - Then make an alternate mansion with a different theme & furniture/clue/etc numbers ("spooky manor" instead of "mystery mansion"), spare rooms & clues ?
  - Then make a different game with a similar system
